Mediatek MMDVFS driver binding
=========================================

The Mediatek MMDVFS(Multimedia Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) driver
is used to set clk for Mediatek multimedia hardwares, such as display, camera,
mdp and video codec. MMDVFS driver reads which clock muxes and clock sources
are used on this platform from DTS, and set current clock according to current
voltage changed by dvfsrc_vcore.


Required properties:
- compatible : shall contain "mediatek,mmdvfs".
- operating-points-v2: contains any one of opp tables for multimedia modules.
                       MMDVFS uses it to get voltage setting on this platform.
- mediatek,support_mux: contains a list of clock mux names defined
                        in clock-names.
- mediatek,mux_*: a series of properties with mediatek,mux_ prefix.
		  Each property represents one clock mux, and its value is a
		  list of all the clock sources for it. The postfix * and every
		  item in the property must be from the clock-names.
- clock, clock-names: list all clock muxes and clock sources for multimedia
		      hardwares.

Optional properties:
If the platform needs frequency hopping for some clock sources, these following
properties should be set.

- mediatek,support_hopping: a list of clock names supporting frequency hopping.
- mediatek,hopping_*: a cell with the same size as opp numbers of an opp table
		      for any MM module and each entry represents the clock
		      rate for each opp. For example, the first entry is the
		      clock rate set in opp-0, and the second entry is the
		      clock rate set in opp-1.
- mediatek,action: a cell with one entry.
		   It represents the action taken when setting clocks.
		   0 or this property is not set:
		   	Do not set frequency hopping and just set clock mux.
		   1:
		   	If the voltage is increasing, set frequency hopping
		   	first. If the voltage is decreasing, set clock mux
		   	first.

Example:
	opp_table_mm: opp-table-mm {
		compatible = "operating-points-v2";

		opp-0 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <315000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <650000>;
		};
		opp-1 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <450000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <725000>;
		};
		opp-2 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <606000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <825000>;
		};
	};

	opp_table_cam: opp-table-cam {
		compatible = "operating-points-v2";

		opp-0 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <315000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <650000>;
		};
		opp-1 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <416000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <725000>;
		};
		opp-2 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <560000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <825000>;
		};
	};
