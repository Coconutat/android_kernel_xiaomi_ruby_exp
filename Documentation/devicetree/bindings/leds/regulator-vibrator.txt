Regulator Vibrator Device Tree Bindings
Registers a regulator device as vibrator.

Required Properties:
- compatible : Should be "regulator-vibrator"
- vibr-supply : Power supply to the vibrator.
  refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt
- min-volt : The minimum voltage value supplied to the vibrator regulator.
- max-volt : The maximum voltage value supplied to the vibrator regulator.

Optional properties:
- min-limit: Set the minimum time in ms for vibrator , default is 15ms,
  if user request duration is smaller, this value will be used instead.
  the default value comes from the smallest unit that can be sensed by the test.
- max-limit: Set the maximum time in ms for vibrator.
  if not set, it means no max limitation.

Example:

		mt6359_vibr_ldo_reg: ldo_vibr {
			regulator-name = "vibr";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1200000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
			regulator-enable-ramp-delay = <240>;
		};

		regulator_vibrator {
			compatible = "regulator-vibrator";
			min-volt = <2300000>;
			max-volt = <3200000>;
			max-limit = <15000>;
			min-limit = <15>;
			vib-supply = <&mt6359_vibr_ldo_reg>;
		};
