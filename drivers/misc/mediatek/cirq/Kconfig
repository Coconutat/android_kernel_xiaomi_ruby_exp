config MTK_SYS_CIRQ
	bool "sys cirq"
	help
	  System interrupt controller(SYS_CIRQ) is a low-power interrupt
	  controller which is designed to work outside MCUSYS as second level
	  interrupt controller. With SYS_CIRQ, the MCUSYS can be completely
	  turned off to improve system power consumption without losing
	  interrupts.

config FAST_CIRQ_CLONE_FLUSH
	bool "fast cirq clone flush"
	depends on MTK_SYS_CIRQ
	help
	  Legacy CIRQ driver clone and flush IRQ pol/sen/pending very slow,
	  since it checks every IRQ to decide if it should clone or not. This
	  config speed up the process by only clone once when the sysetm first
	  enter low power mode. and only setup cirq IDs for wakeup source.
