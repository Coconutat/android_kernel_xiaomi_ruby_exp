	  Choose this option to enable mediatek misc iommu driver.
	  For common kernel, misc iommu includes the secondary feature
	  about m4u hardware. For example, it can implement m4u secure
	  driver for secure feature or debug feature.

	  Choose this option to enable mediatek secure iommu driver.
	  For SVP or secure camera feature, user only can access
	  continuous secure memory, and the number of secure memory's
	  bit no more than 32. So the secure memory need to map to mva
	  by m4u. Secure m4u driver can map non-physical continuous
	  secure memory to continuous modified virtual address.

	bool "Enable Mediatek M4U debug feature"

	help
	  Choose this option to enable mediatek iommu debug driver.
	  According to the characteristic of hardware, we need to add
	  some debug information. For example translation fault, hardware
	  dump information and so on. In addition, for ion buffer, we can
	  use dma_buf information to monitor iova, but if user use
	  "dma_alloc_attrs" to allocate buffer, we can not monitor iova.
	  So we can use list to save all iova node and dump it.
