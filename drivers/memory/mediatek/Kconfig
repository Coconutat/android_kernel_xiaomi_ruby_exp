	depends on MEMORY
	select MEDIATEK_DRAMC
	select MEDIATEK_EMI
	help
	  This driver supports the Memory Controller (MC) hardware found on
	  MediaTek(R) SoCs. The config selects MEDIATEK_DRAMC and MEDIATEK_EMI
	  for the control of DRAMC and EMI drivers respectively. This config
	  will be enabled by default for MTK SoC.

config MEDIATEK_DRAMC
	tristate "MediaTek DRAMC driver"
	help
	  This selects the MediaTek(R) DRAMC driver.
	  Provide the API for DRAMC low power scenario, and the interface
	  for reporting DRAM information, e.g. DRAM mode register (MR) for
	  DRAM vendor ID, temperature, and density.

config MTK_EMI
	tristate "MediaTek EMI driver"
	depends on HAVE_MTK_MC
	help
	  This selects the MediaTek(R) EMI driver.
	  Provide the API for MPU registration, EMI MPU violation handling,
	  the API for EMI information, the BWL golden setting,
	  and the sysfs for EMI ISU control.

config MEDIATEK_EMI
    tristate "MediaTek EMI driver"
    help
    This selects the MediaTek(R) EMI driver.
      Provide the API for MPU register and handle EMI MPU violation,
      the API for EMI information, and the sysfs for EMI ISU control.
